# Ice & Fire Challenge

## Technologies

This is a requirement for the challenge. For this project, **App Router** is being used to take advantage of RSC and Server Rendering.

### TypeScript

This should be a standard for any modern project.

### Tailwind

Due to limited time and project low complexity, Tailwind is the best option for styling.

### HeroIcons

A nice icon library which integrates perfectly with React.

### server-only

A simple library to make sure the code it's executed on the server.

## Architecture
